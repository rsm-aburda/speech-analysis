# Speech Analysis Tool

## üìñ Overview
The **Speech Analysis Tool** is designed to help users improve their public speaking skills by analyzing the number of filler words used in a speech. By uploading a video or voice memo, the tool identifies and counts filler words like "um," "uh," "like," and "so," providing actionable insights into a speaker's confidence and clarity.

> _"You can't improve what you can't measure."_  
This tool helps users visualize their filler word usage, promoting self-awareness and encouraging better public speaking habits.
